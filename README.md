# Project Overview
This is the website we used to show datas in our database.

We made an iot project for our Practical Research subject during our Grade 12 years. It's made with arduino and is supposed to be a payment system using RFID.


## Note
I might add the arduino and node-red code in the future, but only if I can find them.
